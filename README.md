# Chefs Lounge Cloud

This was part of my project for my honours degree, it was transfered from my old Github account to this one.

This handles the communication between both apps and mongodb.

## Abstract from Project Documentation
The system is a smart system that will be a valuable tool to the management of a small to medium sized restaurant. The system offers a wide range of tools to increase productivity and profits. All of these features are accessible. The system comprises of two main parts, one part the customer will download to their smart device and the other is the one the restaurant uses to access all of the admin functions. Also for the communication of both apps to be seamless, a custom Node.js server will be built and deployed to the cloud. Both apps are branded to match the client’s brand to seamlessly integrate with the rest of their business. This means each time this system is deployed to a new client it will need to be re-designed to look and feel as if it is unique to the client. All interactions between the app on the customer’s device and the system will be for the restaurant in question only. For the communication of both apps to be seamless, a custom Node.js server will be built and deployed to the cloud.
